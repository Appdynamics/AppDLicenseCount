AppDLicenseCount
===========

The AppDLicenseCount is a solution is can be used to get a license count from an 
AppDynamics’ controller using the REST service. The solution start by collecting 
information from all of the applications, nodes and tiers then produced a license 
usage excel report. The solution counts only active agents and counts a license 
if it is up. The general active agent count is also provided so that active agents 
can be compared of the hours of the days.

Requirements:
-------------------
The AppDLicenseCount solution is dependent on the AppDRESTAPI-SDK 
               (https://github.com/Appdynamics/AppDRESTAPI-SDK.git) this should be 
cloned and built before cloning this package. It is recommended that both packages 
share a base directory, this will make the dependency checking easier. Compile and 
package the AppDRESTAPI-SDK to insure files that are needed are present. Once this 
package has been cloned edit the file called ‘one_time_git.properties’, insure the 
location of AppDRESTAPI-SDK and the version of the jar file are correct. The file 
‘one_time_git.properties’ should not be sync'd with the git repository after it has 
been edited because the settings only apply to your environment.

The file contains two variables please insure that they are correct (insure that no 
extra spaces are present):

appd_rest_base=../AppDRESTAPI-SDK

appd_rest_jar=RESTAPI_1.0.9.jar

Building:
-----------
To build the package run the following command within the appdLicenseCount directory
      ant -f AppD_build.xml

This will create a directory called execLib with all of the necessary libraries to run the tool.
